Complements are used in digital systems to simplify subract operations
FOr each radix(r-base of number system) system there are two types

Radix Complement - refered to as r's complement
Diminished Radix Complement - as (r-1)'s complement

Binary System Complements 
base r = 2 

1's complement - 
Number     = 110011 
Complement = 001100

2's Complement - 
Number     = 110011 
Complement = 001100
            +     1
2's Compl  = 001101
